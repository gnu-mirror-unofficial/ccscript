GNU ccScript is a C++ class framework for creating a virtual machine 
execution system for use with and as a scripting/assembler language for 
state-transition driven realtime systems.  The most common example of this
is as the core of the scripting engine found in GNU Bayonne.
<P>
GNU ccScript uses a class hierarchy and one extends the ScriptInterp base 
class to create a new dialect localized for a given applications.  One 
then binds script keywords to method calls in the derived class.  This
aspect of GNU ccScript resembles in C++ the process of how one might
localize tcl.
<P>
GNU ccScript is intended for use where step execution is important, and 
where each step is in response to a callback event or a state machine 
transition.  It offers deterministic execution and low overhead so that 
many concurrent instances can be running together.
<P>
GNU ccScript can execute text files which form the basis of a script 
language.  However, in addition to offering step machine execution, 
GNU ccScript loads all scripts into an active image at once.  This is for 
performance, as all operations in the script system, to assure 
deterministic execution, are in memory.
<P>
GNU ccScript also offers the ability to load new scripts in-mass.  
Existing active sessions operate on the currently loaded scripts, and new
sessions are offered the new script.  When the last active session on an 
old script set completes, the entire script set is flushed from memory.  
This enables one to operate scripted servers like GNU Bayonne without
downtime to rebuild script images in memory.
<P>
GNU ccScript is derived from and requires the use of GNU Common C++.  It 
is not a stand-alone class library.

<H4><A HREF="#TOCdownloading" NAME="downloading">Downloading GNU ccScript</A></H4>
<P>
Starting with release 1.7.0, GNU ccScript will be found on 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ccscript/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ccscript/</A>
or one of <A HREF="/prep/ftp.html">the mirrors</A>.  The most current 
release is 1.8.1.
<P>
GNU ccScript may be
available from other sites in various "package" formats, including 
GNU/Linux "RPM" packages, ".pkg" files under various Unix operating systems,
etc.  I do encourage people to distribute GNU ccScript in a package form
where convenient for installation, so long as source is also made available.

As the current GNU ccScript maintainer, I am very open to bringing new 
ideas and code into GNU ccScript.  In particular, I am looking for help 
with documentation.  Anonymous cvs access 
is maintained for GNU ccScript thru savannah, and I would be happy to 
receive and  evaluate patches for inclusion in future releases.  A 
standard e-mail mailing list for GNU ccScript will be available shortly on 
<A HREF="mailto:ccscript-devel@gnu.org">ccscript-devel@gnu.org</A>.  
Feel free to send any bug reports, patches, and questions to this list.
