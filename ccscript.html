<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>GNU ccScript is a C++ class framework for creating a virtual machine
execution system for use with, and as a scripting/assembler language for
state-transition driven realtime systems. The most common example of this
is as the core of the scripting engine found in GNU Bayonne.</p>

<p>GNU ccScript uses a class hierarchy, and one extends the ScriptInterp base
class to create a new dialect localized for a given applications. One then
binds script keywords to method calls in the derived class. This aspect of
GNU ccScript resembles in C++ the process of how one might localize Tcl.</p>

<p>This library is intended for use where step execution is important, and
where each step is in response to a callback event or a state machine
transition. It offers deterministic execution and low overhead so that many
concurrent instances can be running together.</p>

<p>GNU ccScript can execute text files which form the basis of a script
language. However, in addition to offering step machine execution, GNU
ccScript loads all scripts into an active image at once. This is for
performance, as all operations in the script system, to assure deterministic
execution, are in memory.</p>

<p>GNU ccScript also offers the ability to load new scripts in-mass.
Existing active sessions operate on the currently loaded scripts, and new
sessions are offered the new script. When the last active session on an old
script set completes, the entire script set is flushed from memory. This
enables one to operate scripted servers like GNU Bayonne without downtime to
rebuild script images in memory.</p>

<p>GNU ccScript is not stand-alone class library. ccScript3 is derived
from and require the use of [GNU Common CPP Framework|GNU Common C++]. Later
releases depend on uCommon.</p>

<h3 id="status">Current Status</h3>

<p>In 2017, the latest release is ccScript&nbsp;5.1.0.</p>

<p>I am looking to add more database plugin modules for GNU ccScript.
In particular I wish to add plugins for direct access to Postgres and MySQL,
and for SQLite, as well as the current unixODBC-based plugin.</p>

<h3 id="downloading">Downloading</h3>

<p>Current releases of GNU ccScript are found on the <a
href="https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ccscript/">GNU FTP site</a> or one of its <a
href="/prep/ftp.html">mirrors</a>. Please use a <a
href="https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ccscript/">nearby mirror</a> if you can.</p>

<p>GNU ccScript may be available from other sites in various package formats,
including GNU/Linux RPM and Debian packages, <code>.pkg</code> files under
various Unix operating systems, etc. I do encourage people to distribute GNU
ccScript3 in a package form where convenient for installation, so long as
source is also made available.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>Class documentation can be generated from sources by Doxygen. It is also
available online for</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="refman/html/">ccScript 5.1.0</a>, and</li>

  <li>ccScript3, as part of the larger <a
  href="/software/commoncpp/commoncpp.html#documentation">class framework documentation
  for GNU Telephony</a> (several versions).</li>
</ul>

<p>Several versions of the Scripting Guide are available online:</p>

<ul>
  <li>version 4, in <a href="/software/bayonne/script4.html">HTML</a>, <a
  href="/software/bayonne/script4.pdf">PDF</a>, and <a
  href="/software/bayonne/script4.tex">LaTeX</a> formats,</li>

  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802040025/http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/Bayonne_2_Scripting_Guide">
  version 2</a> (archived), and</li>

  <li><a href="/software/bayonne/script.html">version 1</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contributing">Contributing</h3>

<p>As the current GNU ccScript maintainer, I am very open to bringing new
ideas and code into GNU ccScript. In particular, I am looking for help with
documentation. The source code repositories can be accessed anonymously
through the <a href="https://sv.gnu.org/projects/ccscript/">GNU ccScript
project</a> on Savannah; I would be happy to receive and evaluate patches for
inclusion in future releases.</p>

<p>The ccScript mailing list is <a
href="mailto:ccscript-devel@gnu.org">&lt;ccscript-devel@gnu.org&gt;</a>. It
has a <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/ccscript-devel">web
interface</a> for subscribing, modifying subscription options and searching
the list archives. Feel free to send any bug reports, patches, and questions
to this list.</p>
